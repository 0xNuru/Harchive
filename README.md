## **About **
<p>Our team at Harchive believes that patients deserve better, and that's why we've built Harchive  - a platform that allows patients to securely and easily access their health records in any hospital they check into. 

Our platform provides a secure, user-friendly solution for managing and accessing medical records anywhere, anytime. 

Here are some of the key features that make us stand out from the crowd
First a patient registers under an insurance scheme and is automatically enrolled into our system and given a unique ID and password."

When the patient checks into an accredited hospital, they only need to provide their ID and password once. After the initial check-in, any of the hospital workers that need the patient's health records only need their ID to access them

For each medical procedure, the health worker in charge of the respective units updates the patient's health records. Health workers can only view or add to the patient's health records, but they can't edit past records to ensure immutability.

The hospital provides medical services to the patient and submits a claim to the insurance company through the platform. The insurance company can access the claim associated with their patients from the platform and use the transaction information to check for any suspicious activity or patterns

With Harchive, patients can easily continue treatment from any accredited hospital by ensuring interoperability between accredited hospitals. Only accredited hospitals can access patient health records from the platform. And every health worker who deals with the patient record has a login that allows them to use the platform under the permission of the hospital they   a third party and access other online health services."</p>



## **API Model Breakdown**

Our API is organized around REST principles. It follows predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs.

## **Authentication**

To use our API, you need to authenticate your requests using an API key, which you can obtain by registering for an account on our platform. Once you have an API key, include it in the Authorization header of your requests like this:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```
